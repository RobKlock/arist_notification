# arist_notification
This is a microservice to handle notifications that I wrote for Arist as part of the hiring process. I had some trouble deploying it with Docker, but as of the due date, everything else works. 
I'm going to keep working on it until it works as expected. I've included a reflection on my time spent working on this in reflection.txt
